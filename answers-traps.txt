Q1: which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A: a2

Q2: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A: The call may be optimized out by the compiler. 

Q3: At what address is the function printf located?
A: 0x630

Q4: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main? 
A: 38

Q5: Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      

 What is the output?

 The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what 
 would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
A: (1) He110 World (2) No

Q6: In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
A:
